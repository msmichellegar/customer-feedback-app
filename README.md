## Tech Stack

Technologies I used to build this chat app:

- React - for rendering UI
- Next.js - to set up a basic SSR React app
- TypeScript - for type safety
- Styled Components - for styling
- Normalize.css - to initialise styles
- Rechart - for data visualisation
- Formik - for form state management
- Jest - for testing
- React Testing Library - for testing React

## Improvements

Improvements I would make with more time:

- More unit tests - I wrote a couple to start with, but would ideally like full coverage
- End to end tests - testing the overall functionally with a tool like Cypress
- Persisted feedback data - currently I'm seeding feedback with a JSON file, and storing any new additions in memory - ideally new additions would be written to the JSON file, or stored in a database
- Better rating UI - more intuitive UI for leaving a rating (like the [star rating component](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/simple-is-best-dressing) I built for Bon App√©tit in 2020)
- Accessibility audit - a full review of accessibility using automated tools - specifically there needs to be a strategy around making the chart accessible
